# Test Automation Framework
> The project covers the basic scope of creating TAF, including:
> - Creation of a user for testing 
> - basic REEST API tests
> - basic E2E tests

**Test Automation Framework (TAF)** - the environment required for test automation including test harnesses and artifacts
such as test libraries. 

A **test automation framework** that is easy to use, well documented and maintainable, supports a consistent approach to
automating tests. In order to establish an easy to use and maintainable TAF, the following framework meets expectations such as: 
- Implement reporting facilities 
- Enable easy troubleshooting 
- Address the test environment appropriately 
- Document the automated test cases 
- Trace the automated test 
- Enable easy maintenance
- Keep the automated test up-to-date
- Plan for deployment
- Retire test as needed
- Monitor and restore the SUT (System Under Test)

The components that make up a test automation framework include test data, driver scripts, environment variables, 
general user library, object repository, and tests execution report. 

Natural benefits of implementing automated tests:
 - It eliminates repetitive manual testing that consumes lots of time and effort.
